This App provides a platform that allows the user through a REST API to perform CRUD operations such as (create, read, update, delete) for the back-end data base.For the user interface our frontEnd will serve the information and allow you to display the new data created by the user by re-rendering React.js components.

# :recycle:Motivation

Our motivations for developing the app was to apply all the knowledge acquired over our time learning at the School of Code and testing our knowledge Working in a team of six  to deliver the app within the time given by implementing agile software development methodologist. Also developing valuable software that aims to contribute to minimize one of the main problems for global environment that is the problem of consumption.
## The Problem 

We live in a world where as each day or year goes by, the planet we live in is being destroyed by the millions of tonnes of waste that could instead be recycled. 
Our goal is to help make our world a more sustainable place, and we are doing that by helping our users exchange and give away free items that they would otherwise throw away.
